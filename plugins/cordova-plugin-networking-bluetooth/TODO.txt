Nice to have features in the future that are not essential:
- Implement the setName method for changing the friendly name, and report the
  name changes (ACTION_LOCAL_NAME_CHANGED) to the onAdapterStateChanged event.
- On the deviceInfo objects, it would be nice to perform a service discovery
  (on Android: fetchUuidsWithSdp), in order to have a reilable uuids array
- On the deviceInfo objects it can be useful to show the DeviceClass
- Chrome implements the getInfo and getSockets functions in order to have more
  information about the sockets.
  If these functions will be implemented in cordova-plugin-networking-bluetooth,
  they will not necessarily have all the fields of the Chrome SocketInfo object.
