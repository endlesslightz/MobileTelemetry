# :warning: DISCONTINUED - Cordova base64ToGallery Plugin
This plugin (based on [devgeeks/Canvas2ImagePlugin](http://github.com/devgeeks/Canvas2ImagePlugin)) allows you to save base64 data as a png image into the device (iOS Photo Library, Android Gallery or WindowsPhone 8 Photo Album).

The plugin is a kind of fork of the [solderzzc/Base64ImageSaverPlugin](https://github.com/solderzzc/Base64ImageSaverPlugin) but with a cleaner history (a.k.a: no tags from Canvas2ImagePlugin repo) and a newer iOS implementation.

## Alerts

### Plugin id - [issue #1](https://github.com/Nexxa/cordova-base64-to-gallery/issues/1)
In order to be more consistent with the cordova naming convention, since version 2.0 the repository name and the cordova plugin id have changed to **cordova-base64-to-gallery**.

Please uninstall the old version and reinstall the new one.

### cordova-ios > 3.8.0 - [issue #3](https://github.com/Nexxa/cordova-base64-to-gallery/issues/3)
According to the [documentation](https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/blob/master/guides/API%20changes%20in%204.0.md#nsdatabase64h-removed), `NSData+Base64.h` class was removed starting from version 4.0.0 of the **cordova-ios platform** (and it was already deprecated from version 3.8.0).

So, cordova-base64-to-gallery plugin **from version 3.0.0** has changed the iOS implementation in order to support the changes in cordova-ios platform.

If you need to support cordova-ios < 3.8.0 please refer to [cordova-base64-to-gallery@2.0.2](https://github.com/Nexxa/cordova-base64-to-gallery/tree/2.0.2). There is also an "**old**" branch that might have some updates in the future (Android/WP8 fixes or something like that).
